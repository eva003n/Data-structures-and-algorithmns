## Insertion
### At beginning
- Involves shifting the elements to the right.
Using the reverse traversal method
- Insert element at first position

Time complexity = O(1)
Space complexity = O(1)

### At given position
- Involves shifting the elements to the right until we reach that position
- Insert the element

Time complexity = O(n)
Space complexity = O(1)
### At end
- Inserting the element at the last position
Time complexity = O(1)
Space complexity = O(1)
